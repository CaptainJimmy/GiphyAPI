#Giphy API Portal

I wrote this to work with the Giphy API.  Content is generated with jquery calls to the DOM, buttons are generated dynamically, and the button clicks pull 10 pictures from the selected topic from a random offset with AJAX. Jquery events are used for button clicks, and to change the .gif state between animated and still.

Toolsets used: Bootstrap, Jquery, Ajax, JSON, Random Offsets, Javascript, CSS
